below are the points which i where submited so below that are not perfect so make it perfect 


Hi everyone,

Good evening.

Below are the minutes of meeting on quality project updates held on 8th Sep’23  :

•	Discrepancy observed in the date format at our end after downloading illogical data: Start time in data appears for Oct-Nov-Dec which is not possible since the data is for Jul-Aug-Sep
o	R&M team will be sharing required columns with MDPL and they will share the correct dates with R&M team
•	Door locked instances are appearing in the downloaded illogical data 
o	For this, we should try to re-negotiate with the vendor on compliance part
o	We can also try calling out a sample of HHs to re-verify whether the HH was really not at home that day

•	Certain fields in the data are appearing blank in illogical data and this could be because of some data download issue or these questions are not mandatory
o	Re-look at the illogical questionnaire and make questions mandatory incase they are not mandatory

•	Address not found or address mis-match instances are observed in illogical data
o	MDPL should plan RM visits to these HHs to understand whether the issue is in the address
o	This issue will be resolved once IPMS is launched as IPMS has a feature of finding address using Google maps

•	Channels watched and LSAH & LMOSH has a mis-match and this is a surprising observation found in illogical data
o	For eg: Non- south Indian language speaking HHs, are watching channels where only South language content is aired and these channels do not have sub titles
o	R&M team will identify occurrence of such cases and do some deeper level of analysis like time spent on these channels and frequency of viewing these channels to understand the reason for viewing such channels
o	MDPL mentioned that asking reasons for watching a particular channel could lead to probing and if the respondent is female then asking more detailed questions to them on their interest in the content by a male interviewer can be mis-interpreted

•	TECH will get back on the Similarity analysis portal data

Please let us know in case of any queries.

Regards,
xyz
