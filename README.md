"The footfall for the required day is calculated using footfall of the previous two weeks of that specific day." 

1.	Data Processing:  
•	Footfall undergoes various transformations. 
•	Time-related calculations are performed.
•	Cumulative sum of Activity/Counter is done for each group in ‘EID’ and ‘Gender’. 
•	Additional mapping is done for ‘SG’, ‘TC’ and ‘City.’
2.	Randomization and filtering:
•	A Random number is generated and used for sorting the data.
•	Filtering of data can be done by count of lines and by rand 0.67 or rand 0.5 or tbh_even (tbh_even is count  by of ‘EID’, ‘2hdp’,’Activity/counter ’ ) respectively. 

"The footfall for the required day is calculated using footfall of the previous two weeks of that specific day." 
1.	First we read the footfall csv which contains details like EID (Restaurant id), Date, Time, Activity/Counter, Gender, Key ID, Lat, Long and username.
2.	Time- related calculations are preformed where we convert time to seconds, hourly day part, two hourly date part also based on the columns EID and gender we group the number of male-female in that Restaurant at that time.
3.	Additional mapping is done for ‘SG’, ‘TC’ and ‘City.’
4.	We concatenate the previous two weeks footfall of that specific days.
6.	Filtering of data can be done by count of lines and by rand 0.67 or rand 0.5 or tbh_even (tbh_even is count  by of ‘EID’, ‘2hdp’,’Activity/counter ’ ) respectively.

"The footfall for the required day is calculated using the footfall of the previous two weeks on that specific day."

Data Processing:

Footfall undergoes various transformations.
Time-related calculations are performed.
Cumulative sum of Activity/Counter is computed for each group in 'EID' and 'Gender.'
Additional mapping is applied for 'SG,' 'TC,' and 'City.'
Randomization and Filtering:

A random number is generated and utilized for sorting the data.
Data filtering can be conducted by the count of lines or by rand 0.67, rand 0.5, or tbh_even (tbh_even represents the count of 'EID,' '2hdp,' 'Activity/Counter').
"The footfall for the required day is calculated using the footfall of the previous two weeks on that specific day."

Read the footfall CSV, which includes details like EID (Restaurant ID), Date, Time, Activity/Counter, Gender, Key ID, Lat, Long, and username.
Time-related calculations are performed, converting time to seconds and creating hourly and two-hourly date parts. Grouping is done based on the columns 'EID' and 'Gender' to count the number of males and females in that restaurant at that time.
Additional mapping is applied for 'SG,' 'TC,' and 'City.'
Concatenate the footfall data from the previous two weeks for the specific days.
Data filtering can be done by the count of lines or by rand 0.67, rand 0.5, or tbh_even (tbh_even represents the count of 'EID,' '2hdp,' 'Activity/Counter')
