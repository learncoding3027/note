Problem Breakdown:
Problem Statement You are given a list that can contain positive and negative integers. You need to find two elements such that their sum is closest to zero.
For example, you are given a list [-4, 7, 6, 2, -5]. The two elements with the sum closest to zero will be -5 and 6.

Input: A list of integers, which may contain both positive and negative numbers.
Output: A pair of numbers whose sum is closest to zero.

Sample Test Cases:
Test case 1:
Input: [-4, 7, 6, 2, -5]
Output: (-5, 6)

Test case 2:
Input: [-50, 34, -19, 24, 33, 10, -46, -38]
